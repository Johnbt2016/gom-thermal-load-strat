# Interactive 1D thermal modeling in the Gulf of Mexico

The model uses a Neural Network trained for the Gulf of Mexico basin.

The Neural Network has been trained following the methodology initially described in
[Petroleum Systems Through Economic Assessment of the Permian Basin, Texas Aided By a Cognitive System for Geosciences](https://www.searchanddiscovery.com/abstracts/html/2018/ice2018/abstracts/3005524.html), Laigle et al., 2018. It delivers instant temperature, thermal stress and maturity predictions at the ~ 99.9% level of accuracy compared to a full physics basin simulator.

Understand the impact of the parameters:

* **Depth uncertainty** : scales the entire geological column by the factor selected; for example reflecting uncertainty in seismic depth conversion
* **Neogene erosion** : varies the amount of late Paleogene/early Neogene erosion to investigate the timimg of maximum thermal stress and maturity 
* **Basement parameters** : vary the crust and upper mantle structure. Crust thickness and Radiogenic Heat Production (RHP) determine the crustal contribution to heat flow while the depth to the aestenosphere changes the distance to the lower boundary temperature of 1330 degrees C

on present temperature, maximum-reading thermal stress and thermal stress indicators Ro (not recommended in marine aquatic organofacies!) and Tmax. The color bar represents the typical instantaneous maturity intervals corresponding to expulsion of low GOR early oil (dark green) through volatile oil (yellow) to dry gas (red) and beyond the gas window (grey).

You can also load your own model as an Excel file for instant, full physics, temperature and maturity results.
